About Wirth's law:
- What Intel giveth, Microsoft taketh away.
- The speed of software halves every 18 months. (Gates' law)
- Software efficiency halves every 18 months, compensating Moore's law. (David May's law)

> Today's computers have gotten very fast. Moore's Law states the the number of transistors that can be built into a microchip will double every two years. Theoretically, this means that (in general) the speed of a computer doubles every two years. This law has held true for a long time now. Computer processors get faster and use less power as technology advances.

> So, a computer from two years ago should be twice as slow as a new computer today, correct? That would be true, if computers were only hardware, but computers also need software to perform any kind of useful task. Wirth's Law states that computer software is becoming slower faster than computer hardware is becoming faster.

> The modern software developer has gotten lazy. When computer programming was beginning, programmers had to be careful with resource usage, and to make sure their programs ran as efficiently as possible. Many programs were written in assembly or C, and highly optimized. Then computers got faster, and faster, and faster, and now today, programmers write code in C# or Java, which get compiled to byte-code (not machine code) and interpreted by a virtual machine, and use garbage collection, because today's programmers can't even manage memory properly, I can't think of a better way to waste resources. Nowadays, everybody is worried about "going green" and conserving our planet's natural resources, but in the meantime we are wasting all of our computer machine's resources.

> How do programmers get away with writing such bad code, you ask? They don't care, and many of them believe that computers are so fast now that no one will notice. Unfortunately, nobody is noticing, but the only reason is because nobody knows what good software looks like anymore. Computers 20 years ago could run with 4 megabytes of memory and less than 20 megabytes of hard drive storage, now we have 3 terabyte hard drives, or solid state drives, and 16 gigabytes of memory, and we still use all of it. We don't do new things, we watch videos, write documents, browse the web, so why do we need all that RAM and hard drive space?

Ready Player One, Chapter 18:

> And then, before I could stop myself, the words just came out.
> 
> “I’m in love with you, Arty.”
> 
> She didn’t respond at first. She just looked at me in shock as our avatars continued to drift in orbit around each other, moving on autopilot. Then she switched to a private voice channel, so no one could eavesdrop on our conversation.
> 
> “You aren’t in love with me, Z,” she said. “You don’t even know me.”
> 
> “Yes I do,” I insisted. “I know you better than I’ve ever known anyone in my entire life.”
> 
> “You only know what I want you to know. You only see what I want you to see.” She placed a hand on her chest. “This isn’t my real body, Wade. Or my real face.”
