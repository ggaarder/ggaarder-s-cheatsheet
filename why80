Why Insist on the 80 Line Limit Instead of Using Line-wrapping

Line-wrapping works great in X, however not in terminal. It will look at this:

```
                                (unsigned char*)foobuffer[i*j + k] = l*m + fac\
(n)
```

Can you notice the slash at the end of the first line? It is the
"line-continue" sign, for example, in Emacs.

And when you tried to this line using X, let's assuming you are using a virtual
terminal in X, the slash will be taken to where it is pasted.
