# Multi Desktop

You can switch to another virtual terminal and `statrx` to get more desktops.

# Mount DD

You can mount a dd'd file. Like:
  
  $ sudo dd if=/dev/sdd  > /mnt/sda6/01/ipod_180331.dd
  $ sudo umount /mnt/sdd
  $ sudo mkdir /mnt/sdd
  $ sudo mount -o ro ipod_180331.dd /mnt/sdd
  
# Build with TCC

    $ ./configure CC=tcc

# Get a core dump

> @lzprgmr: To clarify: the reason why core dumps are not generated by default is that the limit is not set and/or set to 0, which prevents the core from being dumped. By setting a limit of unlimited, we guarantee that core dumps can always be generated. – Eli Courtwright Aug 9 '11 at 12:30

# Convert Medias with FFMPEG

    $ ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.avi

# Grayscalize a PDF

Using GhostScript:

    $ gs -sOutputFile=output.pdf -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sColorConversionStrategy=Gray -dProcessColorModel=/DeviceGray -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH input.pdf

or using ImageMagick:

    $ convert -colorspace GRAY color.pdf gray.pdf

# Convert PDF to Image-Based Ones

    $ pdftoppm -r 300 text.pdf | convert -page A4 - text.pdf.ppm.pdf

> This converts to a pixel-based format and increases file size significantly (10x for my test case).
